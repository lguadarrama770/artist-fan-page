        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <img src="images/MALUMA-bio_2020.jpg" class="bio">
        <p> Juan Luis Londoño, better known by his artistic name Maluma, is a Colombian singer, songwriter, and actor signed to Sony Music Colombia, Sony Latin and Fox Music.
            Although he took an early interest in soccer and competed in the lower divisions in the teams Atlético National and Equidad Sports Club,
            during his teenage years, he developed an interest in music and began recording songs at the age of 16.
            A year later, in 2012, he released his first debut album <em>Magia</em>.
            However, his breakthrough album was 2015's <em>Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy</em>, which led to successful collaborations with several artists. 
            He released <em>F.A.M.E.</em> in 2018, to further commercial success. He followed it up with 11:11 in 2019, 
            and released his latest album <em>Papi Juancho</em> this year, 2020.

        <p>Maluma has the vocal range of a tenor
        (A tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the countertenor and baritone voice types. It is one of the highest of the male voice types.) 
        He has said that his main musical influences have been Ricky Martin,  Héctor Lavoe, Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson.
        </p>
        <p>After his collaboration with Ricky Martin on "Vente Pa' Ca", he told Billboard:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluma_(singer)#:~:text=He%20has%20won%20a%20Latin,%2C%20Latin%20trap%2C%20and%20pop.">
            <b>"Ricky Martin is one of the artists I wanted to be growing up. He's my idol in the industry."</b>
        </blockquote> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Maluma defines his music as "pop urban". A Billboard editor wrote:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluma_(singer)#:~:text=He%20has%20won%20a%20Latin,%2C%20Latin%20trap%2C%20and%20pop.">
            <b>"Maluma’s brand of reggaetón syncs nicely with his image, managing to be both romantic and raw. His sound represents an evolution of the genre."</b>
        </blockquote>

    <div>
        <p>In an interview in 2016, he stated:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluma_(singer)#:~:text=He%20has%20won%20a%20Latin,%2C%20Latin%20trap%2C%20and%20pop.">
            <b>"I grew up with this genre [reggaeton] that literally became life. It is one of the genres that I sing... I am an urban performer, I sing reggaeton. 
                If you listen to my last album [Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy] there are ballads, mambo, merengue and reggaeton and underground stuff. I like to show the versatility that I have to perform."</b>
